welcome to my proejct page for a 1960 band.

this page is designed to be a simple/easy to follow page which is visualy pleasing to the audiance.
with each section clearly defined and with interactive functions.

the website is a single page with links to the test of the page at the top.

the website is a mobile first with asset changes as the page size increases.

both the music and videos have a download button/link below them and are both playable.

at the footer section there are social media icons that link to their login pages.

the website is aimed at the age group of 30+ targeting the older generations. the band want to showcase their recent music and their performaces.
along side a way for people to get in touch with them regarding gigs/parties.
the goal iw anted o achieve with this website is to make it very visualy simple and linear so that the older generations can use it.

the mobile first navigation bar is styled so that it isnt hard on the eye, but it is there if the user needs it.

the menu will stay at the top of the screen as the user scrolls down the page
so they dont have to worry about getting lost on the page.

all aspects of the page are centerd where possible to give the effect of focus and simplicity to keep the user engaged.

the background pictures in every other section act as a page divider and makes the page look profesional.

the form at the bottom of the page is there so it is easy for the users to get in contact with the band by filling put the form.
the goal with this was took simple but efective in use.

the downlaod buttons are made ot be interactive so when the user is hovering over the button or if it is pressed, then the color will change
indicating that it has been activated.

future changes
 possible changes in the future may be that there is video box wiht buttons to the left and right of it to skip the next video.
 this would make the page look cleaner and add more interactive.
thank you for inspecting my page.


    
technologies used

for the project the workspace i used was cloud 9
for styling i used css and bootstrap 
for saving/storing my work i used git hub
for the interactive menu i included j query



Testing

to ensure that my work works on all platforms and pages i used "inspect element" on firefox to change the dispaly sizes. 
i have clicked all of the links on the page to ensure they work including the download buttons.
i have opend the page on other browsers such as google and internet explorer to ensure the page loads correctly.
i have taken each element out of the project and used them in a practice page. which is shown in the project-1 file file.
i tested the contact form to make sure the specific requirments were running.

the project was initilay created in a firefox browser, as firefox being one of the most used browsers it is very similar to that of google
the only difference in apperiance would be the music play box and the video play box.
in google the diffeneces are that the music play box has rounded edges and is white in color.
the difference in the video box is that the video box has a transition color when there is no video.

there were only one issue i came across and that was that the links didnt work. after changing the code around i found that it worked.



to deploy the project i used git hub. the diffence between there will be no difences between the developed and the deployed version
